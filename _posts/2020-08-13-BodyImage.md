We as men have historically been conditioned to suppress how we feel. The reason many men struggle to talk about anything emotional is that we have historically been encouraged not to.

As an early millennial, growing up in a rapidly changing yet still conservative and old fashioned India, we were encouraged to push those pesky feelings deep down. We were taught to treat emotions like the old steel trunk cases in our attics; keep them out of sight and out of mind. We popped our worries in these trunk cases, locked them shut and threw away the key. Right up until very recently every generation of Indian men have literally been taught to live life as per Amitabh Bachchan’s dialogue in Mard (1985) – “Jo mard hota hai usko dard nahin hota hai”.

So it isn’t surprising that when I first thought of writing about body image in men, I felt a bit awkward. Truth being told the only time I’d heard men talk about their bodies out loud is when we are joking amongst each other about how long or short our ‘Peckers’ were or showing off our muscles in a game of one-upmanship.

I can confidently say that all the boys in secondary and high school, either exercise or join a gym at least once in their lifetime with the specific goal of “bulking up”. There’s the notion that -  as a man, I have to look a certain way, act a certain way - and all guys will agree that there’s one major contributing factor we can credit for this perception amongst both men and boys: the silver screen. 

Rewind back to the late 80’s or even the early 90’s and filmmakers could get away by making their hero wear ugly sweaters, to hide a suspected beer belly while dancing with heroines in Swiss locales. But then came the mid 90’s and the era of Sanjay Dutt, Salman Khan and later Hritik Roshan which forever changed the perception of how a ‘man’s man’ or a hero should look. The hero’s image got extended to the shape of their body as well; they don’t just have to be tough anymore; they now have to look the part as well.

And it’s not just the silver screen, over the last few decades even children's action figures, like GI Joe have become more muscular!

Today, the female body positivity movement is stronger than ever. Whether we agree or not with the direction this movement is taking is a different subject altogether and one which I want to talk about as well, but that’s for another day. As a part of the female body positivity movement there have been recent efforts by many multinational brands to lift the long-running stigma associated with having an “imperfect” body. While there’s no denying that there’s a plethora of evidence that women are judged more by their looks than men are, research shows that body image issues facing men are just as complex. Both men and women go through these struggles, but body image concerns are spoken about much less in relation to the male experience. Maybe one of the reasons for this is that since the beginning of time, male partners have placed a greater emphasis on their partner’s looks while female partners tend to emphasis on other characteristics.

As men we have always had to confine to certain norms of masculinity. The society has always type-cast us in the role of a protector; someone who is strong and tough, someone who doesn’t cry or breakdown, someone who doesn’t ask for help, no matter how grave the situation might get. These societal norms are what gave rise to the all too familiar toxic masculinity that threatens the well-being of all the genders alike. However, the truth is that men struggle with body image too. 

As if these traditional societal norms were not enough now men have to live up to having a masculine and muscular physique in addition to traditionally masculine personality characteristics and qualities such as being strong, stoic, a leader, emotion-less, independent and logical.

To many women, it seems that it is very easy being a man. We all have heard the phrase, from our wives and girlfriends a million times: “You won’t understand…all you have to do is take a shower, throw on some jeans and a t-shirt, and you’re good to go.” 

I’m not going to sit here and pretend that there are no advantages to being a man; this isn’t a sad soap opera after all. I will not deny the fact that being a male in this world comes with its set of advantages, privileges and opportunities. Still, it is also important to acknowledge that many genuine problems and anxieties that we as men face are seldom discussed.

The truth is that many of us face the exact same societal pressure to be the masculine archetype we all see in magazines: a six-pack body wearing a perfectly fitted suit paired with an expensive watch, having thick and great hair with a chiselled jawline. But always remember this, for every Shilpa Shetty figure someone is jealous of, there’s a Shahid Kapoor that makes looking in the mirror hard for men of all ages.

Thankfully today, albeit slowly, things are changing. More men than ever before are talking about their mental health, which is a much-needed shift in attitudes – after all, suicide is the biggest killer of men under 40.

We’re now talking about things that I wouldn’t have even considered when I was in school. And as our society gets better at dealing with mental health, we need to make sure that men’s body image isn’t left out of the conversation.

An easy first step is simply to accept your body for what it is. As the famous quote says, “The first step to change, is accepting your reality right now” (and this is where I digress with the body positivity movement in its current form, but more on that later). It doesn’t matter if you’re super fit or totally out of shape — try to be happy with the way you look. Once you do that then start taking active steps to be healthier through exercise, diet or ideally both. 

Once you begin this process make sure to embrace the journey. Instead of focusing on what you don’t like, be proud of yourself for trying to change what you can control.

Moreover, remember that it’s totally normal to feel some insecurity about the way you look. Try and be kind to yourself, develop positive habits, and do your best to accept what you can’t change to give yourself a healthy outlook on your body (my idea of body positivity).

While most women want to reduce weight as their number one goal, men in general want to build muscle along with weight loss. This can lead to over-exercising and the use of image enhancing drugs. The key is to focus our goals on sustainable eating and exercise habits that you can maintain long term and pay less attention to how you look than to how you feel. By not doing this we risk damaging the body we want to perfect. 

Those hours in the gym require food for fuel, but if we don't eat right to keep up with the energy we've expended, our heart may slow and our blood pressure could drop. Both are dangerous. We also may compromise our bone health permanently.

The use of image enhancing drugs like anabolic steroids causes problems, too. They can stunt growth and, over time, may lead to heart disease, kidney problems and liver damage.

The other one thing I hear the most about the disparity between men and women’s appearances is, “Men get to age gracefully, while women have to keep working at it.”

As a man whose now nearer to his 40’s than his 20’s I find this sentiment to be confusing. It seems ridiculous to assume that men don’t have to do anything. Are you trying to say that we should leave it up to chance, and somehow still might end up looking like Akshay Kumar or Suniel Shetty when we’re older? Why does this idea exist?

Let me make it clear once and for all, irrespective of what gender we belong to, all of us have to work hard to look the way we want to. This is a fact which cannot be denied nor disputed.

Lastly I would like to say that the point of this article isn’t to compare experiences or deem that one sex has it harder than another. The point of this is to let you know that embracing your body, being positive, and being the best version of yourself (whatever that might be) is just as important an issue for men as it is for women.

And my fellow hombres, remember that reaching out is not a weakness and loving yourself is not “unmasculine”.

Devendra Garware.
