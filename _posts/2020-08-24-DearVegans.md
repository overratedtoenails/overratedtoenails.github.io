Dear Vegans,

Let me just start off by saying that I have immense respect for people who choose to maintain a vegan or vegetarian diet. Moreover, depending on where you live, the socio-economic backgrounds you come from and the pressures in your work/social life, it can be difficult to maintain a balanced, satisfying diet that doesn’t contain animal products. It requires a constant kind of conscious living and is a lifestyle choice that embodies much needed compassion. Also it is important to mention that this letter isn't about the health pros and cons of the vegan diet, and I’m not seeking any arguments around that issue. What you eat or do not eat is a choice that you are free to make.

Now before I get into the meat and gravy of this thought of mine, I just want to say one thing. Please don't see this letter as an attack. As I mentioned above, I respect freedom of choice. Also, I have some vegan friends and family. I am not against vegans of the world. I simply know that the vegan diet is not for me.

Our relationship with food is so much more than just food, you know. Food and flavours are part of our culture, have a part in our history and likely have a spot in our heart (like the smell of my mother’s chicken biryani on a lazy Sunday afternoon). As most vegans aren’t born vegan and only become vegan later on in life thus I do understand that imitating these flavours can serve a variety of purposes.

And thus I don’t have any issue with you calling your food with names of certain flavours, aromas and textures which remind you of food that you used to eat, but I do have an ethical issue as well as a logical problem with you calling your food with names like meat, milk and eggs.

I get that having a breaded, spiced and fried piece of cauliflower or a grilled soy patty is a way to satisfy the desire for those flavours. But I don’t understand the need to call that piece of cauliflower as hot and spicy cauliflower wings or calling soy patties as vegan steak. 

From 2018 France has passed a law which states that food producers will no longer be able to use "steak", "sausage" or any other meat term to describe products that are not partly or wholly made up of meat.

The measure will also apply to vegetarian or vegan products marketed as dairy alternatives.

Failure to comply will lead to fines of up to €300,000 (£260,000).

The regulation, which was tabled in the form of an amendment to an agriculture bill, was proposed by a farmer MP, who argues that products such as vegan sausages and other vegetarian alternatives are confusing for consumers.

The logic behind this is that labelling cannot be misleading as to a food's primary composition." So, while "vegan meat balls" is a no-go, just, "vegan balls" is absolutely ok. 

In many EU countries the proper naming of dairy products is already enforced. As per law words relating to dairy, like "milk," "cheese," and "yogurt" must refer to foods that come from "mammary secretions." And thus on grocery shelves what we call "almond milk," for example, is labelled as “almond drink" or "almond beverage." 

As I was trying to do some research to understand the thinking behind calling vegan food with non-vegan names, all the articles that I came across had downright silly examples which tried to reason that calling it wings or steak makes it easy for new vegans to understand. And then I came across one example given by a famous vegan to justify calling meat names to vegan food as paraphrased below:

*“The first time that I took my friend to a Mediterranean restaurant, she looked at the menu completely befuddled. She’d never heard of* [*baba ganoush*](https://cadryskitchen.com/air-fryer-eggplant-vegan-baba-ganoush/)*, dolmas, or falafel. These things were totally new to her.*

*To help her get an idea of what these items were, I translated based on foods she already knew.*

*I told her those falafels are kind of like hush puppies.*

*Are they exactly like hush puppies? No. They’re made with different spices and ingredients. But they are both round balls of dough that are deep-fried. It gave my friend an idea of what to expect.”*

I read this, and then I read it again. What a load of crap (pardon my language). In my head I kept thinking that my dear vegan friend explained the difference between the two and didn’t call hush puppies as falafel, there’s a huge difference between calling falafels as Arabic hush puppies and logically explaining the difference between the two!

Then this person continues to argue that *“**Our steak doesn’t need to be called ‘fake steak;’ it is a steak.”* And in all honesty I agree that it doesn’t have to be called “fake steak”. There is a word in the English dictionary, called “Patty”. Just call it what it is, why try and use words which mean meat? Food for thought; when I see people saying that an ingredient really imitates some form of meat, doesn't that itself make it seem like it's something one strives for or misses in their food?

If you try and research about this like I did, you’ll find that every article out there is defensive. For me this is a classic response when you don’t have a defence or a logical answer. I would also like to say that whenever asked a question as to why you use meat names, there is no need to start talking about ethics or how much beef pollutes.

So, dear vegans or vegetarians, please stop dishing out contempt as though it’s the same thing as advocacy. An entire brigade of high horses won’t help you win an argument. I know that not every vegan is a preachy type. However, in my experience, the majority are. No one is saying veganism isn't great for the world. But you don't need to be a vegan to save the world. And honestly good on you if you're a vegan because it's not easy. But there are also plenty of other ways we can all do our bit. Stop thinking you're a victim just because that's the choice you decided to make.

Love,

A non-vegan.
