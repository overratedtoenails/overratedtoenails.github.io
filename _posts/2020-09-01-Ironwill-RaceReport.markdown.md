### **Back Story**

I am fairly new to this sport that we call Triathlon, having only been introduced to it in June 2019. But just like every other triathlete, the ultimate aim from day one that you begin your journey as a triathlete is to one day finish an Ironman Triathlon and hear Mike Reilly announcing “You are an Ironman”. As odd as it may sound, I actually signed up for my first full Ironman (Ironman Tallinn) back in October 2019 which was originally scheduled to be held in Estonia on 1st August 2020. This was even before I had completed any triathlon event, over any distance. That plan was of course, cancelled this year due to the pandemic. But deep within I knew that even if Covid stopped me from travelling to EU I was somehow going to get an Iron distance triathlon under my belt this year. Thus under the cloud of this pandemic I began my training around April without knowing how, when or where I was going to race.

 

### **Training**

When it comes to training for this multi-sport, from the very beginning I knew that the areas I needed to improve on significantly were cycling and strength training. I had only taken up cycling in mid of 2019 and knew how weak I was in this. In February 2019 I finished my second half iron triathlon and the bike leg really took everything out of me. Not only with my lack of speed but I knew that my body or my chassis as I like to call it wasn’t strong enough to withstand a 6 hour/180km bike ride. Thus I decided to use this lock down period to focus particularly on these two areas as running outdoors and swimming were anyway not an option. By mid of June, I found a safe place to begin open water swimming and started to practice there. As pools were closed and there was uncertainty with outdoor activities in general, the sole focus with swim training was to build up to the 3.8km distance. No speed training, no drills, nothing. Just pure focus was to ensure that come August, my swim training was adequate to get me to the finish. I’ve been running since early 2019 and having done multiple marathons, 30k’s, half marathons etc. since then, I was pretty confident about this aspect. I know that if I got off the bike then I would finish the marathon somehow.

### **Race Preparation**

By July it was starting to become clear that travelling to EU was no longer going to be possible. I started looking for different events around the world but by end of July I knew that travelling anywhere was going to be impossible. Thus my only option was to do the race in my home city of Pune.

So unlike other events where I am only a participant, for IronWill I was also the organiser. This meant the added pressure of not just finishing my first Iron distance triathlon, but also organising an event which covered 226km. When I floated this idea, thankfully and to my relief, it received tremendous support from my friends and family. Over 30 people offered to volunteer in anyway necessary to help me achieve this goal. Although it took some effort, I do believe that the meticulous planning we did by trying to cover each and every aspect of the race helped tremendously to get me over the finish line.

### **Pre-Race**

I took Thursday and Friday off from work to start preparing myself mentally to get through Saturday (Raceday). Thursday morning I woke up early as usual, went out for a 45 min easy run, gave an interview for my local radio then finished making my transition boxes, checking on the bike and all other pre-race checks. In many ways this was good because it kept me busy all day. Friday was a different story all together. My only job on Friday was to hydrate and rest. This was difficult as having nothing to do meant that I kept thinking and overthinking about Saturday. So in the afternoon I decided to meet my coach and some friends over a cup of coffee. This helped and after that I went into an almost Zen mode. I had my carb heavy meal at 7pm, saw a lovely video made by all my friends and family wishing me the very best and then we to bed at 8pm. To my surprise I dozed off by 8.30pm and had a good 6+ hours of uninterrupted sleep. 

I woke up without an alarm by 3am, had my breakfast early enough to give my system enough time to digest the meal. Had a nice hot water shower, got changed into my swim wear and left for the race by 5.30am.

### Swim [3.8km]

We were aiming for a 6.30 to 6.45 am start depending on the sun as the dam where I was swimming needed us to trek 300 meter through some rice fields and we didn’t want to do that trek without sunlight. There was a local news channel that wanted to cover my solo attempt and thus had to speak a few words with them (although at that moment I didn’t want to). Having finished speaking to the reporter we decided to start immediately. Thus without much further ado I took the plunge at 6.36am. The funny thing about an Iron distance triathlon is that the swim happens so early in the race and is relatively such a short part of your day that by the end of it all you almost forget that it even happened. I went it with a 1.30hr expected finish time but the swim went better than I expected and I finished in 1.17hr. This is again where my upper body strength training helped. I used all my upper body strength for this knowing that for the rest of the day I didn’t need to use my shoulders or arms that much. I had to pee during the swim, so I know the hydration part was working well.

**Nutrition:** One packet of carbonance in 700ml water prior to the swim. 
**Time: 1 hr:17min:36sec**


### **T1**

Straight from the swim ran through the fields, into my car to take me to the main road where my bike was parked. I changed into my cycling gear in the car. So everything was pretty straightforward and as planned.

**Nutrition:** One GU Roctane Gel, one salt tablet and one banana, 250 ml Gatorade
**Time: 8min:17sec**

### **Cycle [180km]**

It was nice and sunny up until that moment. As soon as I sat on the bike, it started raining and the rain did not relent throughout the bike leg. My biggest challenge with cycling 180km was always going to be the road conditions. There were patches which were riddled with potholes and the rain made it even trickier. I did not want a puncture and thus had to be super slow and careful negotiating these. The other challenge is the lack of empathy by motorists towards cyclists. I sometimes wonder if there’s a vendetta sworn by all motorists to convert cyclists into roadkill. Another unique challenge for cycling in rural India is traffic jams created by water buffaloes, had to negotiate around one such herd. Pune is quite hilly and cycling to Lonavala and back means negotiating a lot of ascends. This makes the chosen route quite challenging but also fun. As this was not an event the roads were open to traffic and being a highway it was quite busy. We also had to negotiate through a traffic jam at the toll near Japaloupe Equestrian center at around 160km of the bike. As we crossed Kamshet going towards Lonavala, we got some strong headwinds and visibility due to heavy downpour was also very poor, but having practised cycling in aero-position, I could stay low on the bike to counter this. The main issue with this was that I couldn’t speed on downhill portions as we had to be on the brakes because of super wet conditions. 

I do think my nutrition and hydration was spot on (stopped twice to pee) and finished my bike leg without any cramps. My target pace for a wet weather race was sub 6hr:15min so all in all, considering the conditions, I think the bike leg was the strongest part of my race. All my training came good.

**Nutrition:** Five GU Roctane Gels, Six salt tablets and 5 bananas, Approx. 2.6 to 2.8 litre Gatorade.
**Time: 6hr:00min:56sec**

### **T2**
Again no complaints did everything as planned. As I was soaking wet changed all my clothes. It didn’t matter much because it was still raining and in 2km I was completely drenched again. I also peed once again before going off on the run.

**Nutrition:** One GU Roctane Gel, one salt tablet and one banana, 250 ml Gatorade
**Time: 9min:16sec**

### **Run [42.2km]**
I started my run thinking, all I had to do is finish 42.2 km marathon and I was going to be an Ironman for the rest of my life. I’ve run marathons before and I know how though they are, so I wasn’t under any illusion about the magnitude of the task ahead of me. So I’ve heard, read and been told multiple times that Ironman begins during the second half of the marathon. Thus I wanted to execute a positive split strategy because I had trained for this and knew what to expect from my body till the halfway point. My plan was to finish the first half of the marathon as fast as possible without walking. I am happy that I managed to do this exactly as planned. But by 21km I really had to use the loo from all the bananas I had been eating since morning. I thought of putting it off but was starting to get uncomfortable and had reached a point where I would not have been able to eat or drink anything further without going to the toilet first. Although I know that this is a sign that everything was working well, it did break my momentum. My pace dropped post this loo break and could not pick it up again. In hindsight, I should have gone to the toilet at T2 and will keep this in mind next time I attempt this distance. Also would like to add that by then it finally stopped raining.

My run route was basically 8 loops of 5.2km (balance 600 meters was distance to and from my house to my run route). For the first 4 loops I averaged a steady 6.30 min/km pace without having the need to walk. But finally half way through loop 5, I started doing run-walks. I did not have cramps, nor was I de-hydrated. I was just exhausted. This is my only regret as I like running long distances and before this I had never ever done a run-walk ever in any race or training. I had heard that people walk the Ironman marathon (now I know why) and had secretly promised myself not to walk during my attempt. 

Getting through the next 15km was probably the toughest thing I have ever done in my life. The last 5km of the marathon again felt easier, I felt I was running faster but my splits don’t show much difference. I switched from Gatorade to Coke & Doritos around 30km mark and then continued having it till the finish at every aid station. The extra sugar definitely helped but by then eating or drinking anything was difficult and I had to force feed myself. I finished the marathon in 5hr:04min and am honestly disappointed with the timing. Running, I still feel is my strongest discipline amongst the three and maybe I should or could have pushed a little harder to get a sub 5hr time atleast.

The finish was super special. It was amazing to see all my friends and family cheering for me as I finished. Many of them had been with me through the day and I’ll be eternally thankful to all of them, for without their support I would have probably not finished. At the finish, the only thing going on in my head was, “it’s over, it’s done, I don’t have to run anymore”. It was a sense of relief more than anything else.

**Nutrition:** Four GU Roctane Gels, Five salt tablets, a few Oreos, a few Doritos, Approx. 2.5 litre of Gatorade/Coke/Water.
**Time: 5hr:04min:37sec**
  

### ***Total Time: 12hr:40min:48sec***


### **Post-Race**

Body was sore, mind was exhausted. Yet 5 min after I finished I was already ready to do my next one. I am not a very emotional person, but I did have a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. Not just of finishing my first Iron distance triathlon, but for the training I had put over the last 4 months despite the world going into a lockdown. For wanting something and then working hard to make it happen. This somehow feels like life coming to a full circle or maybe a fitting end to a 900 day journey which started from being classified as Class 1 obese with Gout and Cholesterol to being known as the guy who did what is probably the only known solo Iron distance triathlon successfully completed by an Indian.

### **What’s next?**

A new journey, a new challenge awaits.

I definitely want to hear Mike Riley shout the words “Devendra Garware you are an Ironman” out loud. So an official Ironman race attempt will happen for sure. But the world of Ultra running also fascinates me. I haven’t decided yet but will make a decision over the next few weeks. But for now, it’s time to sit back, relax and bask in this sense of accomplishing something that a year ago seemed impossible.

Cheers!

Devendra
